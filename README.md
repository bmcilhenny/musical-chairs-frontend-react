## How to play musical cheers
Best with 5+ players. Pour about a 1/5 of beer into a total of however many solo cups as you have players. Choose your playlist, your players, your device (make sure spotify is open on either your laptop or phone at all times, otherwise those devices won't appear in the set up game screen), and begin round. Users walk (read dance) around the table till the music stops, then it's flip cup time. The last person to flip their cup is out. Continue until one guzzler remains standing. Rinse. Repeat.
