## How to play musical cheers
Best with 5+ players. However many players will be playing, place that many solo cups around the table. Then pour about a 1/5 of beer into each cup. Choose your playlist, your players, your device (make sure spotify is open on either your laptop or phone at all times, otherwise those devices won't appear in the set up game screen), and begin round. Users walk (read dance) around the table till the music stops, then it's flip cup time. The last person to flip their cup is out. Remove that cup from the table. Refill, then play the next round until one guzzler remains standing. Rinse. Repeat.
